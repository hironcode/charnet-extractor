"""
This .py file is a set of functions that help identify characters in a text

Steps:
(1) use Named Entitiy Recognition (NER) to identify person entities
(2) automatically anotate a gender to each entity based on:
    (a) honorific or titles such as Mr., Mrs., or Lord etc...
    (b) lists of male first names and female first names
    (c) detecting pronouns such as him, her, his, her, himself, and herself etc...
(3) integrate person entities that refer to the same characters by:
    (a) grouping person names with similar names (refer to
    https://aclanthology.org/W14-0905/ for more information)
    (b) by excluding pairs that satisfy the following criteria:
        "(1) the inferred genders of both names differ
        (2) both names share a common surname but different first names
        (3) the honorific of both names differ, e.g., “Miss” and “Mrs.”"
        (reference: https://aclanthology.org/D15-1088/)
